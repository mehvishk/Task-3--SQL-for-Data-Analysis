📊 SQL for Data Analysis — Task 3
This repository contains my work for Data Analyst Internship – Task 3, where I performed SQL-based data extraction, transformation, and analysis using the Olist E-commerce Dataset (olist.sqlite).

📁 Project Overview
The objective of this task was to analyze structured data using SQL and generate insights through various queries such as:
* Filtering and sorting
* Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
* JOIN operations
* Subqueries
* Creating views
* Query optimization using indexes
This project demonstrates practical SQL skills used in real-world data analytics.

🗂 Dataset Information

Dataset used: Olist E-commerce Public Dataset (SQLite format)
File name: olist.sqlite
⚠ Note: The dataset is NOT uploaded in this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.
It was used locally on my system.

You can download the dataset here:

🛠 Tools Used
* SQLite (primary database engine)
* DB Browser for SQLite
* GitHub for version control

🧪 Work Done
This repository includes:
1. SQL Queries (`queries.pdf`)
Contains all SQL queries for:
* Data retrieval (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
* Aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
* Customer revenue analysis
* Product-level and order-level analysis
* JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT)
* Subqueries
* Views created for repeated analysis
* Indexes created for performance improvement

2. Output Screenshots (`queries.pdf`)
Screenshots of SQL outputs including:
* Query results
* Data summaries
* Join results
* Aggregated results
* View and index creation outputs

🔧 How to Run This Project
If you want to run the SQL file locally:

1. Install SQLite or DB Browser for SQLite
https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/ 

2. Open the database
* Go to File → Open Database
* Select `olist.sqlite`

3. Import queries
* Run queries one-by-one or all at once

✅ Conclusion
This task helped me strengthen SQL concepts used in data analytics, including querying relational data, optimizing performance, and extracting business insights from a structured dataset.
